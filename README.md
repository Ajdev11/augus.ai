Personalized Feedback Loops Model
## Abstract
Personalized Feedback Loops with Generative AI: A Framework for Improving Student Agency and Metacognition in Virtual Learning Environments.
## By Moses Ogunsemore Olaseni
Feedback is a critical element in shaping student learning, particularly in online and technology-enhanced environments where traditional teacher–student interactions
are limited. However, conventional feedback approaches often fail to provide personalization, timeliness, and support for self-regulation. This research proposes the design
and evaluation of an adaptive feedback framework that leverages generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create personalized, iterative feedback loops for learners and students. By integrating
AI-driven feedback personalization with principles of self-regulated learning and evaluative judgment, the study and models aims to foster greater student agency, enhance metacognitive awareness, 
and improve overall learning outcomes. The research will employ a mixed-methods design, combining experimental trials in online learning platforms with qualitative analysis of learner
experiences. This work contributes to both theory and practice by offering to build a model of AI-supported feedback called “AUGUS.AI” that goes beyond assessment, positioning feedback
as a co-regulated, interactive process between students, educators, and intelligent systems.

## Main Topics
This study will address the online learning environment and inner feedback, the role of artificial intelligence in shaping adaptive feedback, the personalization of feedback to meet 
diverse learner needs, the relationship between feedback and self-regulated learning, the development of assessment and evaluative judgment, and the improvement of assessment and feedback
practices in schools.
